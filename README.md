Goal - To optimise Wells Fargo's customer outreach by using data analytics to find the most profitable outreach channels for different types of customer demographics. 

Process - Correlation and Clustering analysis was performed to find the most influential features that contribute to a growth/decline in a customer's account balance. The features that were found to be most influential towards the output were then pipelined into a machine learning model to predict the customer's account balance progression over 12 months.

Result - Three key questions were successfully answered through this project :-
1. What factors drive growth in account balance for customers of each demographic?
2. What demographic types are most likely to increase their number of accounts and account balance over a year?
3. What types of customer interactions, events or outreach channels are most correlated with account or balance change?
